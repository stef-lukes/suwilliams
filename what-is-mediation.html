            <h1>What Is Family Mediation?</h1>
            <p>Family mediation is an independent, impartial professional
                service. A trained mediator will help facilitate all parties to
                work out an agreement. Mediation is recognised as an effective
                alternative to resolving disputes. The courts will expect you to
                have considered mediation before hearing your case. Mediation is
                voluntary and all parties need to be willing to particpate and
                be open and honest.</p>

                    <h3>Separation Disputes</h3>
                    <p>Many couples who have made the decision to separate or
                        divorce may be unable to agree on certain matters
                        including
                        arrangements for the children, all finances matters and
                        property.</p>

                    <h3>Resolving Conflicts</h3>
                    <p>Family mediation is a confidential and impartial process
                        where the mediator helps the parties involved in family
                        breakdown resolve disputes and conflict.</p>

                    <h3>Avoid The Courts</h3>
                    <p>Mediation saves time, money and enables decisions to
                        be made without having to go through the courts. It
                        is a quicker and less costly way of resolving
                        disputes and enables people to work through their
                        concerns in a neutral and safe environment.</p>

                    <p>Mediation can help you stay in control. It supports
                        you to make the decisions. The mediator will help
                        you explore solutions which work for you all and
                        explain how you can make an agreement legally
                        binding.</p>
