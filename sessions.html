                <h2>Initial Assessment</h2>
                <p>
                    You may have heard or been told to attend a
                    <span>MIAM</span>, this is a
                    <span>Mediation Information and Assessment Meeting</span>.
                    At the MIAM you will see the mediator on your own (although
                    you can bring someone for support if you wish). I also offer
                    telephone MIAMs where required.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The process of mediation and how mediation works will be
                    explained. You will be able to discuss your situation, what
                    happens next and what is expected of you. This meeting is
                    also for everyone to assess whether
                    mediation is appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once both parties have been seen by the mediator and
                    everyone agrees that mediation should take place, a joint
                    session will be arranged.
                </p>

            <div class="txt">
                <h2>Subsequent Meetings</h2>
                <p>
                    The subsequent sessions will take place with all parties
                    present each session lasts up to 90 minutes. Everyone will
                    be asked to sign an <span>Agreement To Mediate</span> which
                    shows you are willing to participate and continue with the
                    process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the first joint meeting it will be agreed what you each
                    want to achieve in mediation and what you would like to
                    discuss. If you are in mediation to discuss your financial
                    aspects of you separtaion/divorce it is likely in the first
                    session
                    that the financial disclosure booklet will be discussed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The number of sessions that are required is dependant on
                    many things. However, it is estimated for <span>Child
                        Only</span> cases
                    it may require <span>1-3 meetings</span> and for
                    <span>Property and Finance</span> or
                    <span>All Issues</span> ( both children and finance)
                    <span>2-4 meetings</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mediator is not able to give financial or legal advice
                    you can seek professional advice at anytime. Remember
                    mediation is voluntary it can be stopped at
                    anytime.

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <p>
                    When individuals are in conflict it is hard to see how the
                    outcome can be positive, however if you commit to the
                    mediation process, some resolution can be found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often separating or divorcing couples want documentation
                    that summarises the agreements that have been reached in
                    mediation. Towards the end of mediation the following
                    documents can be prepared.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span>Summary of Financial Information</span> will be
                    prepared if financial issues have been resolved. This is an
                    "open" document which means that it is a factual summary of
                    the finanacial situation. This statement can be used in any
                    financial application at court.

                    A <span>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)</span> is a
                    document created by
                    the mediator that summarises all the propsals made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both these documents can be used to support communication
                    and actions moving forward. However, if agreements can not
                    be
                    reached and a decision has been made to stop mediation then
                    the appropriate court forms can be signed to support an
                    application to court.
